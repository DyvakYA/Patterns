# Introduction

Design patterns are formalized bes practices that the programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system. 

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

 # Getting started
 
 Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
 Programming/Software Design Principles.
 
 All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI, 
 and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles, don`t forget about SOLID and DRY.
 
  Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into
 patterns by any of the following approaches
 
  # Warning
 
 Complexity and patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
 extensibility.
 
 Using design patterns in inappropriate places for this can lead to a violation of the principles of the OOP,
 code readability and application malfunction.
  
 The number of bugs may increase and the code will cease to be supported.
